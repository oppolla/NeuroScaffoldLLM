# NeuroScaffoldLLM: Dual-Model Adaptive Language System for dynamic LLM personalization

## Overview
The ASC System is an advanced AI architecture that combines a large base model with a smaller "scaffold" model for efficient, adaptive inference. The system dynamically coordinates between models using cross-attention and continuously improves through background training.

## Key Components

### Core Models

- **Base Model:** Large frozen LLM (deepseek-llm-67b-chat)

- **Scaffold Model:** Smaller adaptable model (deepseek-r1-distill-qwen1.5-1.5b) with dynamic LoRA layers

- **Production Scaffold:** Stable version deployed for inference

## Innovative Modules

**AdaptiveLoRALinear:** Dynamically adjusts LoRA rank based on learned importance

**SparseCrossAttention:** Efficient top-k attention between models

**CrossAttentionFuser:** Intelligently combines base and scaffold outputs

**SalienceScorer:** Evaluates interaction importance using BERT

## Key Features

### Dynamic Adaptation:

- LoRA layers automatically adjust their rank

- Cross-attention gates scaffold contributions based on confidence

### Efficient Inference:

- Top-k sparse attention reduces computation

- Only activates scaffold when confident

### Continuous Learning:

- Background training scheduler

- Cluster-based data sampling

- Automatic rollback on failure

### Resource Awareness:

- System load monitoring

- Training time limits

- Gradient checkpointing

## Configuration

The system is highly configurable with parameters including:

- Training intervals (default: 5 minutes)

- Minimum training examples (default: 50)

- System load limits (default: 70%)

- Salience thresholds (default: 0.75)

- Training epochs (default: 3)

```
system = ASCSystem()
response = system.generate_response(user_input)
system.log_interaction(user_input, response)
```

## Benefits

- Maintains base model capabilities while adding adaptability

- Reduces computational costs through selective scaffolding

- Continuously improves from user interactions

- Robust against training failures

## Requirements

- PyTorch

- Transformers

- PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)

- Scikit-learn (for clustering)

- PSutil (for system monitoring)
